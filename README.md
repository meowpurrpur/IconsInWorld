# Icons In World

A simple plugin that displays icons directly in the game world instead of on the map. Made for fun, it's my first time making any mods for any game. I created it because Iâ€™m not great at reading maps and find it easier to navigate when icons appear where they actually are.

## Features

- Active Quest Icons + Quest Name
- Gatherer Icons (Shows mining outcrops, mature trees, etc. Only works when on the correct job for gathering.)
- Treasure Coffer Icons
- Party Member Icons
- Summoning Bell + Market Board Icons
- Aetheryte + Aethernet Icons
- Aether Current Icons
